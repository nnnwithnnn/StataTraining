### background on the project
<br>

This course has been made when Narendra identified that still there is much more need to make a course for professional who are new to Stata and wants to learn STATA but due to lack of time and money they are unable to attend classes. As a result, we are coming with a short course so ay one who is newbie can understand and learn STATA.
In this course, you will get few presentations, exercises, and resources to understand STAT and these are must for anyone who wants to learn STATA.

The title (Fundamentals of STATA) is admittedly that here we will make the foundation of learning STATA software only not Statics. We hope that after completing this course you are able to use STATA and also you can do your work easily.

The materials cover:

- an <a href = "/StataTraining/part1">introduction</a> to statistical software
- the fundamentals of <a href = "/StataTraining/part2">coding, and reproducible analysis in Stata</a>
